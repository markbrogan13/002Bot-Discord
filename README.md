# 002Bot -- Wiki

## Getting Started

This bot is a Work In Progress and may or may not be updated on a orderly basis. Also note this is source code, if you dont know how to run a Discord bot or what a developmental side of bot integration is, head over to [Discor.js](https://discord.js.org) for more info!

1. Copy the `discord-client-secrets-example.json` file and rename it to `discord-client-secrets.json`

    - In the `discord-client-secrets.json` file, change the token to your bot's token

    - Set your leading token, the bot will look for this to activate each command

    - Other identifiers in the file are optional edits

1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already, you will need it to run the Bot's services

    - For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) help
